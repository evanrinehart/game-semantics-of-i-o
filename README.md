# Interruption

This game is usually played with 2 or more players. But you need at least 1.

Before the game starts define for each player a type of commands, a type of
questions, and for each question of each player a type of answers.

Each round all players are asked to choose an action. When the round is over
one or more players will append their moves to a move list. The move list
begins empty prior to the first round. Players may review the move list as it
stands to make the choice, but they can't know what the other players have
chosen during the current round.

The possible action choices are:
- issue a command at some time in the future
- ask a question at some time in the future
- resign at some time in the future
- wait for someone else to make a move
